Branch in Git is similar to the branch of a tree. Analogically, a tree branch is attached to the central part of the tree called the trunk. While branches can generate and fall off, the trunk remains compact and is the only part by which we can say the tree is alive and standing. Similarly, a branch in Git is a way to keep developing and coding a new feature or modification to the software and still not affecting the main part of the project. We can also say that branches create another line of development in the project. The primary or default branch in Git is the master branch (similar to a trunk of the tree). As soon as the repository creates, so does the main branch (or the default branch)
